Progress:
- We can get Skype running in Xvfb
- If I install lxde then I can run ldtp (can't figure out how to start dbus otherwise)
- Can't read the chat window directly
- Can send messages by generating mouse and key events
- It is theoretically possible to have skype generate libnotify notifications for incoming messages
- I can't figure out how to read those messages
